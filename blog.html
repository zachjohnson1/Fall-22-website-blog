<h2> assginemnt 1</h2>
<h3>
    <p>For this assginment I did not have to much diffculty.
     The hardest part of this assignemnt was getting the image but with a local refrecne was not to diffcult.</p>
    <p>I leanrd the basic structure of html and I knew some of it so it was a good refresher on the layout of html, 
        and how browsers view html to render pages.</p>
    <p> Honesly for this first assginment it was not to diffuclt to do and, I did not need to look for external help,
        I did however refrance the notes I took in class to recall the basic structure of html, and how to get the image 
        inside my page.
