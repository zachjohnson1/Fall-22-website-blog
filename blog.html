<h2> assginemnt 1</h2>
<h3>
    <p>For this assginment I did not have to much diffculty.
     The hardest part of this assignemnt was getting the image but with a local refrecne was not to diffcult.</p>
    <p>I leanrd the basic structure of html and I knew some of it so it was a good refresher on the layout of html, 
        and how browsers view html to render pages.</p>
    <p> Honesly for this first assginment it was not to diffuclt to do and, I did not need to look for external help,
        I did however refrance the notes I took in class to recall the basic structure of html, and how to get the image 
        inside my page.
    </p>

<h2>assginemnt 2</h2>
<h3>
    <p>For this assingment I found both getting the flex boxes to work as intended, and resizing the immages. to be honest the images where probubly the hardest part, do to the fact that when the flex box gorws and shrinks if you hard set pixle limits on your images they will outgrow or shirnk to far inside the flex boxes. It was this that i found most challengein about the flex boxes.</p>
    <p>I learned flex boxes and the fundamental incorporation of them in the flex boxes. I see how they are important and a general implementation of them is pretty easy, but when you start to get more specific there difficulty only increases from there. I think it was very useful to begin practicing flex boxes.</p>
    <p>I mostly just reviewed my lecture notes but the weeblinks that were provided by the professor were also very helpful, especially those that are for the flex boxes, and their implementation.</p>
    <p>I had to google how to get my images to not overflow from their flexboxes. I also had to google the border implementation for this assignment, for some reason the way we did it in class was not working for me so I had to look up another way to do it.</p>

<h2>assginemnt 3</h2>
<h3>
    <p>For this assginment i found that dom targetting with Js was diffculty. The ablity to hit a specific element given diffrent paramiters was hard. I also found it difuclt to get the atribute ablities to work for the filter and to get the condition attrobute onto new posts.</p>
    <p>I learnd some of the fundamentals of JS. I learned how somethings with dom mainpulation are very easy while other things are diffculty. </p>
    <p>For this one I reviewed the class notes and yous other online resources such as some of the links provided in the assignment. I also looked at others having similar issues on stack overflow. I was unable to use campuswire becuase my account is having issues that I was unable to resolve in time</p>
    <p>I had to google a lot of things for this assginemnt such as error codes I was getting. I also googled how to use the data attribute and a few other things to help along the way.</p>
